# Hi, I'm Vikram!

My name is Vikram Peddinti and I'm currently a kid right out of college in LA playing around with experiementing the cross section of blockchain gaming. I currently lead a team at ICIKL Studios where we are developing Odyssey, a movement focused multiplayer .io FPS shooter on the NEAR blockchain. I'll be using this blog to cover my journey working with my team on Odyssey along with the many side projects I might experiement with!

# Ideas

I wanted to have a central place to have a public list of my blog ideas, and I think I'll leave them right here in the secondary section below :). I just want to shoutout https://github.com/Pitayan/gatsby-theme-pitayan, for these beautiful gatsby theme I'm using for this blog.
